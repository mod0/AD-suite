This directory contains Matlab scripts and data files used in the paper

  An introduction to the numerics of flow in porous media using Matlab
  by J.E. Aarnes, T. Gimse, and K.-A. Lie, SINTEF

The files are located in four subdirectories:

  2phase - saturation solver and driver routines for the 2-phase
           reservoir simulator
  data   - model 2 from the 10th SPE Comparative Solution Project
  MFEM   - the mixed finite element method
  TPFA   - the two-point flux approximation method

Please feel free to use and modify the scripts for educational
purposes. Suggestions for improvements are welcome (send an email to
Knut-Andreas.Lie@sintef.no)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The examples in the paper can be reproduced as follows (notice that all examples
involving the SPE 10 data set may run slow due to the huge amount of data
contained in the "data/spe10.mat" file):

EXAMPLE 1:

>> cd TPFA
>> ex=1; run;
>> ex=2; run;

This will produce plots as in Fig. 1 in the paper.

EXAMPLE 2:

>> cd MFEM
>> runSPE10; plotsl

This will produce the left plot in Fig. 5 in the paper. To produce the
right plot, change "Layer" in the code to 85.

EXAMPLE 3:

>> cd 2phase;
>> addpath('../TPFA');
>> runq5;

This will produce an animation of the advancing water front in a
quarter-five spot, as illustrated in Fig. 6 in the paper.

EXAMPLE 4:

>> cd 2phase;
>> addpath('../TPFA');
>> runspe10wplot;

This will produce an animation of the advancing water front in a
quarter-five spot, as illustrated in Fig. 7 in the paper.
