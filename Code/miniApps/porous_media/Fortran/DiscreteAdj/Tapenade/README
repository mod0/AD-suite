This code is ported from the MATLAB version associated with the publication:

Aarnes, JÃ¸rg E., Tore Gimse, and Knut-Andreas Lie. "An introduction to the numerics of
flow in porous media using Matlab." Geometric modelling, numerical simulation, and 
optimization. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2007. 265-306.

Known limitations:
-----------------
At the moment, there are differentiated versions in both forward and reverse AD mode
using Tapenade. However, there is some manual effort involved in copying over the
differentiated/undifferentiated PMGMRES solver over from their template files in the
respective locations and changing the call from dummy method to these methods.

Also, any time the size of the problem is changes, the above procedure needs to be 
repeated by first running through Tapenade to produce the differentiated code and
replacing the linear solver routines.

Another limitation is that the Z-dimension and probably X and Y too should be atleast
size 2 during the simulation. 

Editing:
-------
Recommended workflow for editing is :

Edit individual files and concatenate using paste command as below to produce numerics
file which can later be passed to Tapenade.


paste --delimiter=\\n --serial fluid.f90 grid.f90 mathutil.f90 matrix.f90 linsolve.f90 fvm.f90 head.f90 > numerics.f90 

Main routines:
--------------
main_deriv_check_adj.f90               - Check the adjoint derivatives against finite difference
main_deriv_check_tanglin.f90           - Check derivative from tangent linear model against finite difference
main_oil_vs_mu_sigma.f90               - Write the total oil output from the simulation as a function of mu, sigma in a space separated format.
main_solver_tuning_adj.f90             - For each problem size, tune the linear solver inner and outer iteration parameters 
main_solver_tuning_tanglin.f90         - For each problem size, tune the linear solver inner and outer iteration parameters
main_tanglin.f90                       - Driver calls both forward and tangent linear model.

TODO:
-----
Need to fix all the interface issues as we would like for the test-suite.
Need to rearrange the files according to the needs of the test-suite.
