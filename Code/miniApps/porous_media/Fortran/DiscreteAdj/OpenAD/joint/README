This code is ported from the MATLAB version associated with the publication:

Aarnes, JÃ¸rg E., Tore Gimse, and Knut-Andreas Lie. "An introduction to the numerics of
flow in porous media using Matlab." Geometric modelling, numerical simulation, and 
optimization. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2007. 265-306.

Known limitations:
-----------------
At the moment, only the function evaluation works and derivatives are yet to be got
from OpenAD. There is some manual effort involved in copying over the undifferenti-
ated PMGMRES solver over from its template filet in the corresponding location and
writing a driver to run the function.

Editing:
-------
Recommended workflow for editing is :

Edit individual files and concatenate using paste command as below to produce numerics
file which can later be passed to Tapenade.


paste --delimiter=\\n --serial fluid.f90 grid.f90 mathutil.f90 matrix.f90 linsolve.f90 fvm.f90 head.f90 > numerics.f90 


TODO:
-----
Need to differentiate using OpenAD (works but does not compile)
Need to fix all the interface issues as we would like for the test-suite.
Need to rearrange the files according to the needs of the test-suite.
