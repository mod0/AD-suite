########## This point onwards, changes made by Mahesh Narayanamurthi 

This directory contains the plain, tangent linear and adjoint version
of the air_foil model (from M. B. Giles, D. Ghate and M. C. Duta)
generated using OpenAD. It does not modify the calls in the validation
code to call the OpenAD version. 

Validation has been performed cursorily by comparing the results of the 
output from the OpenAD version with those from the Tapenade version in
a directory that is the sibling of the current directory (called air_foil)
and independently running the validation code in that.
