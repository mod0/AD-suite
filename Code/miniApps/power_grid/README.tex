\section{Power Generation (not Power Grid)}
\subsection{Author and source}
The power generation test-case is derived from the summer project \cite{Rao_2013} at ANL. A copy of the source code, with some minor bug fixes to the original, is included in the \texttt{git} repository as described below. The application is an optimal control problem to `\textit{`maximize the input power to a generator while limiting its mechanical angle oscillation}'' as described in the reference above.
\subsection{Description of the mathematical formulation}
A general framework for an \textcolor{red}{optimal control} \cite{Sandu_2012} problem is given below:
\[ \theta \,=\, \text{argmin} \;\; \Psi(x, \theta) = \int_{t_0}^{t_F} r\big(x(t), \theta\big)\, dt \,+\, w\big(x(t_F), \theta\big)\]
\[ \text{subject to:} \;\; x' = f(t, x, \theta), \; t_0 \leq t \leq t_F, \; x(t_0) = x_0(\theta) \]
Here, we seek to minimize the cost function $\Psi$ by choosing $\theta$. However, noting that the parameter $\theta$ also decides the value of $x(t_F)$ on which the cost function is dependent. This dependency relation of $x(t_F)$ on $\theta$ comes from the constraint ODE.\\

\noindent Using continuous adjoints, the gradient of the \textcolor{red}{hamiltonian} with respect to the parameters $\theta$ can be written as:

\[\nabla_{\theta} \Psi = w_{\theta}^T\big(x(t_F), \theta\big) + \bigg(\frac{d x_0}{d \theta}\bigg)^T \,.\, \lambda(t_0) +\;\int_{t_0}^{t_F} \bigg(f_{\theta}^T(t, x, \theta) \,.\, \lambda(t) + r_{\theta}^T\big(x,\theta\big)\bigg) dt\]

\noindent The actual problem that is being solved by the power generation example is given below:

\[ p_m \,=\, \text{argmin} \;\; \Psi( p_m, \phi) = - p_m \,+\, c \int_{t_0}^{t_F} \big((\phi - \phi_S)_{+}\big)^4 \, dt\]
subject to: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d\phi}{dt} &=& \omega_B (\omega - \omega_S)\\
\frac{d\omega}{dt} &=& \frac{\omega_S}{2H} (p_m - p_{max} sin(\phi) - D(\omega - \omega_S)),\; t_0 \leq t \leq t_F \\
\phi(t_0) &=& sin^{-1}\bigg(\frac{p_m}{p_{max}}\bigg) \\
\omega(t_0) &=& 1 
\end{eqnarray*}
$\omega$: frequency, \, $\phi$: phase angle,\, $p_m$: parameter\\

\noindent The \texttt{MATLAB} code uses continuous adjoints to compute the gradient of the cost function $\Psi$ with respect to the parameter $p_m$.

\subsubsection{Differentiated code using OpenAD in Forward Mode}

The binaries (\textbf{files}), corresponding to these, on building the directory are \texttt{airfoil} (\textbf{{airfoil.F}}) and \texttt{air\_lin} (\textbf{{air\_lin.F}}) respectively. \\

\subsubsection{Mesh generation}\label{mesh_gen}
The directory \texttt{mesh\_generator} packs a \texttt{MATLAB} script \texttt{naca0012.m} which can be used to generate larger meshes. The \texttt{airfoil} example can read the meshes that are in the ``old'' format. This can be specified while calling the script from \texttt{MATLAB} like below.
\hfill\break
\begin{lstlisting}[language=mymatlab, numbers=none]
>> naca0012(`old')
\end{lstlisting}
The script generates a \texttt{grid.dat} file where the first row contains the number of nodes, cells and edges in the mesh and the corresponding mesh data follows. The size of the mesh can be controlled by changing the parameters \texttt{I} and \texttt{J} in the \texttt{MATLAB} script.

\begin{NotePar}
\noindent To use a new grid file in airfoil code, the parameters \texttt{maxnode}, \texttt{maxcell} and \texttt{maxedge} have to be set appropriately in each of the driver files. Also, note that the \texttt{maxcell} is one more than corresponding value from the \texttt{grid.dat} file.
\end{NotePar}
\subsection{Modifications performed}
Refer section \ref{diff_airfoil}
\subsection{How to build}
Running make as below, in each of the four subdirectories beginning with ``airfoil'' will build the  binaries \texttt{airfoil}, \texttt{air\_lin} and \texttt{air\_adj}.
\hfill\break
\begin{lstlisting}[language=mybash, numbers=none]
    $ make
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{NotePar}
\noindent  The directories \texttt{air\_foil\_wopenad\_split} and \texttt{air\_foil\_wopenad\_joint} will only build the binaries \texttt{airfoil} and \texttt{air\_adj}.\\

\noindent Likewise the directory \texttt{air\_foil\_wopenad\_tanglin} will only build the binaries \texttt{airfoil} and \texttt{air\_lin}.
\end{NotePar}
\subsection{How to verify}
At the time of writing, there exists no script that can validate the output from any of the binaries. All versions of the binary \texttt{airfoil} should produce exactly the same output.\\

\noindent Validation by eyeballing the output from each version of the binaries \texttt{air\_lin} and  \texttt{air\_adj} has been performed. It is of significance to note that the outputs from \texttt{air\_lin} and  \texttt{air\_adj} should also be within certain fixed tolerance from one another.

\begin{TodoPar}
\noindent It will be valuable to write a \texttt{python} script that will take as input two \texttt{csv} files and find the \texttt{max-norm} of the difference between the corresponding entries. Other norms may also be computed. 
\end{TodoPar}

\noindent In order to test the derivatives, since the code does computations deterministically i.e. there are no convergence related iterations, each version of \texttt{airfoil} can be made to write the computed derivatives to a file and the files themselves can be passed to the \texttt{python} script.\\

\begin{TodoPar}
\noindent Additionally, the binary \texttt{testlinadj} can be used to test linear and adjoint routines in \texttt{air\_foil\_tapenade} directory. And by modifying \texttt{testlinadj.F} suitably - by making use of \texttt{oad\_active} type - in each of the other directories, validation can be performed.
\end{TodoPar}
\subsection{How to extend}
\subsubsection{Generating larger grids and flows}
Section \ref{mesh_gen} discusses how to create a larger mesh. Once a larger mesh has been created, corresponding flow has to be now generated. The \texttt{airfoil} application provides all the necessary code to do this. \\

\noindent The file \texttt{input.F} has a section of code that goes as below.\\

\begin{lstlisting}[language=myfortran]
c
c------ read in data from flow file, initialising if necessary
c
        open(1,file='flow.dat',status='old')
        read(1,*) p, r, mach, alpha
        alpha = alpha*datan(1.0d0)/45.0d0
        p = 1.0d0
        r = 1.0d0
        u = dsqrt(gam*p/r)*mach
        e = p/(r*gm1) + 0.5d0*u**2
c
        do ic = 1, ncell
          q(1,ic) = r
          q(2,ic) = r*u
          q(3,ic) = 0.d0
          q(4,ic) = r*e
        enddo
c
        do ic = 1, ncell
          read(1,*,err=999,end=999) (q(ipde,ic),ipde=1,4)
        enddo
 999    close(1)
\end{lstlisting}
\hfill \break
In order to generate the corresponding flows, lines \texttt{19-22} of \texttt{input.F} may be initially commented. A base flow is initialized in lines \texttt{12-17}. Using this, the binary \texttt{airfoil} may be executed for a long time period. When the binary finishes executing, it writes the solution at the end of the simulation to \texttt{flow.dat} file. This file may later be used by uncommenting the lines \texttt{19-22} of \texttt{input.F} to warm-start the simulation with a hopefully converged flow.\\

\noindent Paraphrasing an email from one of the authors of \cite{Giles_2005}:

\begin{verbatim}
 The airfoil testcase was developed several years ago for an
 an AD project using Tapenade:
 http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/~gilesm/codes/airfoil/index.html

 The input.F file initializes a uniform flow at a given 
 pressure, density, mach number and angle of attack. For 
 this technique (of initializing the flow) to be used with
 larger meshes, the timestep in the CFD calculations may
 need to be  lowered to handle strong initial transients.

 The authors used to run the simulation using just this
 technique, letting the simulation warm up by running 
 several iterations. At the end of each simulation the
 updated flow is written to the same flow.dat file which
 can later be used to continue the simulation, if needed.
\end{verbatim}
\subsubsection{Throwing more stuff on the tape, artificially}
One of the intended uses of this airfoil test-case is to test checkpointing algorithms in AD tools. With regards to \texttt{OpenAD/F}
