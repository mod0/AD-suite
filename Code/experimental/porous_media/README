This code is ported from the MATLAB version associated with the publication:

Aarnes, JÃ¸rg E., Tore Gimse, and Knut-Andreas Lie. "An introduction to the numerics of
flow in porous media using Matlab." Geometric modelling, numerical simulation, and 
optimization. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2007. 265-306.

Known limitations:
-----------------
This folder only has the function evaluation/simulation of the MATLAB code ported.

Editing:
-------
Recommended workflow for editing is :

Edit individual files and concatenate using paste command as below to produce numerics
file which can later be compiled along with one of the driver files.


paste --delimiter=\\n --serial fluid.f90 grid.f90 mathutil.f90 matrix.f90 linsolve.f90 fvm.f90 head.f90 > numerics.f90 

DRIVER FILES:
-------------
main.f90                  - runs the forward model and produces production curve graph
main_oil_vs_mu_sigma.f90  - runs the forward model for varying sigma, mu input to produce data needed for
                            surface plot of oil wrt mu and sigma


TODO:
-----
Need to fix all the interface issues as we would like for the test-suite.
Need to rearrange the files according to the needs of the test-suite.
