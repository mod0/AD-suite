generate.m: accepts the size for the grid and a boolean of whether or not initial flow file has to be created and generates all the necessary input files.
One can run generate.m to generate these files and copy them over to the corresponding sub-directory in the data directory and run the code to generate the
updated flow. The updated_flow should then be used to replace the base flow that is created using generate.m
