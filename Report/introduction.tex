\section{Introduction}
Advances in automatic differentiation techniques require testing on applications.
Too often, a developer has no choice but to test out advances on a full fledged application
which can lead to tedious side effects, compilation issues and, debugging.

An alternative, presented in this report is the use of a suite of mini-apps. Each mini-app 
represents features of an application of interest to AD tool developers. One evisions that if
a tool advance is successful on the applications presented herein, the advance is applicable
to a large scale application as well.
